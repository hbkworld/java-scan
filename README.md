./gradlew build
```
and you will find the generated devscan.jar file in the folder
/tmp/devscan/devscan/libs.

The gradlew script has now the ability to deploy jar files and 
pom files to [bintray](https://bintray.com/) and
[Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/). Run
```bash
./gradlew uploadArchives -Prelease -P<repository> -Pgpg_id=<gpg-id> -Pgpg_secring=<path/to/secring.gpg> -Pgpg_passphrase=<gpg-passphrase> -PrepositoryUsername=<name> -PrepositoryPassword=<passwd
```
with either "mavencentral" or "bintray" for `<repository>`.
